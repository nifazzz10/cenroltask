Funtionality

`ComponentA` is a React functional component that renders `ComponentB` and passes a prop `cendol` with a value of 2.

`ComponentB` is a React functional component that takes in a prop `cendol` and displays its value. The component also has an internal state `value` that is initialized with the value of `cendol`. 

The component has a button that, when clicked, increments the `value` state by 10 and changes the color of the button and a circle element. The color alternates between red and blue.

The component also keeps track of the number of times the button has been clicked using the `count` state.
